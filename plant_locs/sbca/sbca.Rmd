  -  Why would a smaller downwind area within a county be advantageous for a polluter? .red_b[Emissions will exit the jurisdiction faster].

__Main Idea:__ In the absence of regulatory avoidance, it should be a 50-50 flip whether the county’s area downwind of the plant (in the EGU’s county of residence) is larger or smaller than the area upwind.

  - .red_b[Focus]: coal. Strongest incentive to avoid regulation.
  
  - .red_b[Placebo]: natural gas. Less incentive to avoid regulation.

# Hysplit: Goals

We do the following:

 1) Quantify how quickly coal-based particles leave their own county and state (it's fast).
 
 2) Quantify the proportion of coal-based emissions that are from other counties/states in any given county/state.
 
 3) Illustrate the implications of 1) and 2) with case studies.

# Discussion

# What did we do?

__Main contributions__:

  - Descriptive results on the geography of physical power plants _and_ their emissions.
  
    - Causal evidence of coal plants strategically locating to minimize downwind area.
  
  - Clean Air Act did not seem to impact strategic siting. 
  
  - Descriptive results on pervasiveness of pollution transport problem from coal powered plants.
