# Amenities

Under the assumption that STRs impact local amenities positively and negatively, it follows that:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \xi_j }{\partial str_j} = \underbrace{\frac{\partial \xi_j}{\partial f}}_{+} \times\underbrace{f'(str_j)}_{+} + \underbrace{\frac{\partial \xi_j }{\partial g }}_{-}\times\underbrace{g'(str_j)}_{+}

\end{align*}

.orange_b[Key Idea]: __The net impact of STRs on residential amenities is ambigious__

 &#8594; STRs may have positive impacts on residential amenities (added restaurants)

 &#8594; STRs also may have negative impacts on residential amenities (more noise)

# Partial Derivatives


Consider a regulation that changes the return on holding a STR. What happens to equilibrium housing prices?

$$
\frac{\partial P_j^\star}{\partial R_j} = \frac{ 1}{ \exp( \frac{R_j}{1-\delta}      )  + \exp(  \xi_j(\cdot) ) )  } \left(   \frac{\exp( \frac{R_j}{1-\delta})}{1-\delta} +  \exp(  \xi_j(\cdot)) \times \frac{\partial \xi_j}{\partial str^\star} \times \frac{\partial str^\star_j}{\partial R_j}     \right) \\
$$

__3 (non-trivial cases):__


 .orange_b[Case 1:] $\frac{\partial \xi_j}{\partial str^\star} > 0 \implies \frac{\partial P_j^\star}{\partial R_j}>0$:

## Question

&#8594;  Is this just a theoretical curiosity? We turn to test our theory empirically.

# Data overview

We combine data from multiple sources:

- .orange_b[Zillow]: Monthly housing price indices (ZHVI) at _zip code level_

- .orange_b[Inside Airbnb + Tomslee]: Publicly available, scraped Airbnb listings

.ul[

&#8594; Scraped at irregular intervals -- combine them to get largest possible sample

&#8594; Characteristics of listings, location accurate to within 500m

]
  

__Focus Area:__ Los Angeles County. Estimation window: July 2015-June 2017

# Specification


Using our model to guide the empirics, we estimate:

\begin{align}
    \log(ZHVI_{zjt}) = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j}\log(listings_{zjt}) + FX + \epsilon_{zjt}%\label{eq:est_eqn-1} \\
    %\log(ZHVI_{jct}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\log(R_{jct}) + FX + \eta_{jct}\label{eq:est_eqn-2}  
\end{align}

where:

&#8594; $ZHVI_{jct}$ is the Zillow Home Value Index for zip code $z$ in jurisdiction $j$ at year-month time $t$ 

&#8594; $listings_{zjt}$ is the number of Airbnb listings

&#8594; $FX$ is a set of fixed effects

&#8594; $\epsilon_{zjt}$ is an unobservable

We use an instrument from Barron et. al (2020) for listings:

  - Interact google search hits for Airbnb, $g_t^{air}$, with num. of restaurants and accomodations estab (NAICS 72) in 2010, $b_{zj}^{2010}$

# Idea and Data

We provide _descriptive_ evidence of our proposed mechanism, using calls to police

&#8594; .orange_b[Hypothesis:] Nuisance calls to police decline after STRs are regulated in SM (may in part negative estimated coefficient)


&#8594; .orange_b[Data:] Santa Monica Open Data Project for 2013--2019

.ul[

&#8594; Geolocated calls with reason for the call

&#8594; Define a call $k$ as being party related if it was for `loud music`, `public intoxication` or `noise complaint`

&#8594; Event study with pre-post as policy date STR regulation went into place

# Conclusion

__Main takeaways__

&#8594; Literature has exclusively focused on STRs and _rising_ housing prices

&#8594; We point out that this is probably right .orange_b[on average]

.ul[
- Averages mask heterogeneity! 

- Less important if this heterogeneity means $\frac{\partial P_j^\star}{\partial str_j^\star}$ still always positive
]

 __Policy implication__: regulating STRs in the name of housing affordability _may_ backfire. 

&#8594; Much more work to be done here, though
